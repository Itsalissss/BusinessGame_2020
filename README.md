# BusinessGame_2020

Bachelor's degree thesis project in Management Engineering at Politecnico di Milano (2020).

The scope is to simulate the management of a company and its strategy in a fictional competing market towards other students, through the analysis of its Operations, Logistics, Finance, Marketing, Research & Development and Human Resources.

Detailed instructions can be found in file "Instructions.pdf". During the project, we had to provide two reports: "1.6_DiGrandi_REL1.pdf" and "1.6_DiGrandi_REL2.pdf".
The first one defines our strategy before the game starts, after an analysis of the current market and the previous management of the company, while the latter provides results and figures at the end of the game.
